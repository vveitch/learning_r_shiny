<p>I have a problem  similar to one below by Mira and TyStudio but I've not found a solution.</p><p> Is there a trick to reading data into the server.r file?</p><p>I have copied the iris kmeans example server and ui files exactly, inserted a statement to read the data file as in census-app and keep getting errors. I've used every combination possible for setting the working directory (including doing nothing since Run App is supposed to set the wd to be that in which server.r and ui.r reside) and data directory and still get an error. [Below is the error and fs is the name of the data set.] I've saved the data as csv, txt and Rds.</p><p>Listening on http://127.0.0.1:6875<br>Error in lapply(obj, function(val) { : object 'fs' not found</p><p>When I execute the data read statement by itself and then Run App, it works fine. So, the read statement works, it points to the right directory and the app works. But, something is keeping those components apart in the app.</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>I'm having a similar issue, including an error with an lapply() function. Like Ken, the app works if I source the scripts manually but not if I call them through the source() command. I've tried every variation of the file name I can think of, and I've also tried changing source()'s local parameter.</p><p>Code at start of server.R:</p><p>library(shiny)<br>source("scripts/0-Prepare-Inputs.R", local = TRUE)<br>source("scripts/1-Analysis-Functions.R", local = TRUE)</p><p>Error:</p><p>&gt; shiny::runApp()</p><p>Loading required package: shiny<br>Listening on http://127.0.0.1:7617<br>Error in lapply(obj, function(val) { : object 'sTableTypes' not found</p><p>Edit: Still struggling with this problem. Additional things I've unsuccessfully tried:</p><p>- Replacing the source() command with all lines of the source files.<br>- Wrapping the creation of sTableTypes in a function that is called in the script file.<br>- Wrapping the creation of sTableTypes in a function that is called as a reactive object.<br>- Saving sTableTypes as an rObject and loading in the source scripts and at the top of server.R.<br>- Saving sTableTypes using super-assignment.<br>- Saving sTableTypes using assign() and specifying envir = .GlobalEnv.<br>- Running the scripts, saving the environment using save.image() and loading the environment using load(..., envir = .GlobalEnv)</p><p>It's worth noting that I updated to the newest version of R this morning in order to upload to <a href="http://shinyapps.io/" rel="nofollow">shinyApps.io</a>. Based on the date of Ken's comment, maybe we are both suffering from the same update? Currently attempting a clean install on another machine.</p><p>Edit2: Found the solution via SO: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26617428/objects-arent-recognized-unless-manually-created" rel="nofollow">http://stackoverflow.com/quest...</a></p><p>Since I used sTableTypes in both server.R and ui.R, I had to source it in both. Sourcing manually created it in a global environment, so that explains why it worked. This can also be done by creating a global.R file, which will create objects accessible to both ui and server.</p><p>Hopefully this helps others struggling with this.</p>

<p>I spent perhaps 2 hours trying to get this to work. Sometimes it works when you load things in server.r. I tried a billion different things. I think that the loading order of server.r and ui.r is something randomly picked, and because my ui.r depends on loading the initial lines in server.r, this causes a crash when ui.r loads first.</p><p>Putting the necessary files into global.r fixed everything! :) :)</p>

<p>Thanks so much for this great tutorial, Garrett. I was hoping you might expand on some of the code in this lesson. The do.call sets up the args two ways: args &lt;- list(...) and args$max &amp; args$min assigned values directly. I've googled the do.call, but don't see any mention of this syntax. Is this generally how the do.call arguments assignment works? If you have a named argument, you can refer to it via ?. Example, for the mean function, you could have</p><p>    args&lt;- list(c(1:10))<br>    args$na.rm &lt;- TRUE<br>    do.call(mean, args)</p><p>Thanks!</p>

I have tried re downloading the data sets and R. helper and I still get an error. I have tried all iterations of the path name and checked that my working directory was correct and I still get the error. Help please?</p>

<p>OK well I can't figure out why the script won't run. I have followed every step and I have asked both my coworkers :/ I know it's a script and not a package. So that won't fix it. I know the script is in my file and looks exactly like yours when I look at it. I can literally go to the folder and click on the R script and see it.  have idea what to do about this so I will try to complete this tutorial again on Monday I guess....</p>

<p>Palmer, are you running the app in the tutorial or is <code> seq.int(rx[1L] - dx/1000, rx[2L] + dx/1000, length.out = nb) </code> your own code?</p><p>The warnings are not related to the min and max labels in slider input. Your code seems to be calling R's <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> functions on an empty vector somewhere in the call stack.</p>

<p>Garrett - I was able to reproduce this problem. I think it has to do with having a default value for the selectInput. For example, here was my code when I saw the error:</p><p>selectInput("selectBox", <br>  label = "Choose a variable to display",<br>  choices = c("Percent White", "Percent Black", "Percent Hispanic", "Percent Asian",<br>  selected = "Percent White")<br>),</p><p>And here is my code that fixed the problem (note the position of the parentheses!):</p><p>selectInput("selectBox", <br>  label = "Choose a variable to display",<br>  choices = c("Percent White", "Percent Black", "Percent Hispanic", "Percent Asian"),<br>  selected = "Percent White"),</p><p>Hope that helps!</p>

<p>I have no idea what happened, but I tried the simple fix of closing down RStudio and rebooting.  And now it works perfectly.  (shrug).  I am guessing I did something with the directory (going to census-app rather than the App-1) and it worked.</p>

<p>TYRstudio, I'm glad that you got it working! It looks to me like you were using the unfinished script from the # Finish your app section. That script sets up exercise 2 but will not work until you replace the question marks with code (the task of exercise 2). I'm sorry for the confusion, I'll add a note to the text to make things more clear.</p>

<p>TY RStudio, I'm not sure what is happening. I can't recreate the error on my computer, which makes it sound like a bug. If you submit a reproducible example to the <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/issues" rel="nofollow">Shiny issue tracker</a> (perhaps with a screenshot), we can try to find and eliminate the bug.</p>

<p>Mira, <code>load</code> gives that error when you try to load a file type that it does not expect (like <code>.rds</code>). To load <code>counties.rds</code>, you can use <code>readRDS</code>, like this <code>counties &lt;- readRDS("census-app/data/counties.rds")</code>.</p>

<p>I'm having trouble with the map function I've created with the "USArrests" dataset that comes with the standard "datasets" library. I've filtered the USArrests dataset to only include data for the 48 contiguous states and created a vector, "states", that I provide as the regions argument in the map command. So, for example, map("state", regions=states, exact=FALSE, ...). But when I run my Shiny app, it seems that some of the states have the wrong shade (e.g., Utah appears to have a high assault rate when it really doesn't). Did I set the "regions" and "exact" arguments correctly?</p>

<p>Sounds like the <code>map</code> function is matching the fills to the states in the wrong order. I remember this being annoying; you basically need to ensure that your fill data exactly matches the order that <code>map</code> plots the states in. I don't remember exactly how I solved this for the counties data set, but I think I joined the data to the counties data set in the maps package to get the order right (which means all of your county names must match).</p>

<p>Is this possibly a bug in Shiny?  I'm getting a bad read from the data when I filter to "% Asian" and set both of the sliders past 60%; there are no counties with that concentration, but all are shaded as if they had a higher %.  I don't get this with the other three options, but think that they have higher concentrations.  I think Shiny may be confused when there is no data that meets the filter criteria.</p>

<p>Hi there - <br>I am putting some source() commands at the beginning of my Server.R file to load in other methods.  However none of these are run when I do runApp().  (The methods from these files still show up as not found).  Any idea why this would be?  Do I have to explicitly ask R to load these files in before running the shinyServer?  Thanks.</p>

<p>Melissa, It might be helpful to have someone look at your code with one of the sites listed at <a href="http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/help.html" rel="nofollow">How to get help</a>. Shiny should run your <code>source</code> commands, just like it runs <code>source("helpers.R")</code> in the examples above.</p>
